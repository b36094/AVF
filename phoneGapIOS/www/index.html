						       	<p><b>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</b></p>
						       	<p>erhaps one of the hardest elements of design and functionality for me this month is to integrate the academic expectation to a concept that I wanted to polish. I've been working on a CRUD app and I wanted very much to learn how to connect it to an API, and perhaps even learn how to create my own PHP API. But I have been finding lots of obstacles in my way, from not being able to find good tutorials for beginners (about PHP APIs) to understanding the RESTful software architecture. We shall see.</p>
						       	<p><b>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding work-flow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</b></p>
						       	<p>The design element is growing on me. I'm realizing how intrinsic this field can be. In the past I would think about design as drawing pretty buttons and setting up nice interfaces. Designing a good application implies so much more than that. Understanding data-flow, data-bases, usability, optimization (and many other core concepts used in software development) is pivotal, and I think we are heading towards the right direction.</p>

						       	<p><b>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</b></p>
						       	<p>Twitter, as do all web social applications, relies heavily on login and payments services. From the beginning the user is being prompted with a login page to differentiate between several credentials and functionalities. Most extensive web-apps utilize a front-end portal access and and back-end portal access. In terms of the “live” data these web applications offer they benefit enormously from a logging system as well. Let's take for instance Twitter's API. After the client registers and activates the developer features, the Twitter's API generates a hexadecimal key to be implemented within the application or other APIs. Therefore, being able to differentiate between several users (loggers) is crucial. The payment features can vary depending on the widget or the service. In Twitter's case developers can make little plug-in or widgets that simplify certain processes. Some of these plug-ins are free and others aren't, and they can (sometimes) represent a good source of partial income for developers. Furthermore, on an API level, some hosts and web service creators (for instance: a weather API) can charge for offering their service to the developer community; also a pretty good source of income.</p>

						       	<p><b>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</b></p>
						       	<p>JSONP stands for “JavaScript Object Notation with padding”, which is a nice easy way of writing data that is both human and computer readable. JSONP is an extension of “JSON” that allows a bridge over the “cross- domain” limitation. This limitation impedes clients from sending data-requests to several domains preventing XXS (Cross-site scripting) security vulnerabilities. The way JSONP helps with this issues is by creating a “call- back” for filtering. If we do not utilize JSONP for our API it would be virtually impossible to pull out from an API because of the XXS security measure that most browsers have set up.</p>

						       	<p><b>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</b></p>
						       	<p>JSON data, as well as JSONP are optimized for mobile devices and portability (in general). With the proper conversion, the JSONP data can be added to the native STORAGE MySQL database service into any mobile platform.</p>
